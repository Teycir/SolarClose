**The Solar Sales Tool That Respects Your Data.**

Most solar software runs in the cloud, meaning they own your leads. **SolarClose is different.** It runs entirely on your iPad/Laptop.

We use a **Business Source License (BSL)**, which means:

1. **100% Transparency:** All source code is public. Your IT team can audit it to prove **zero data leaves the device.**
2. **Free for Individuals:** Independent reps can use it forever.
3. **Auditable Security:** You don't have to trust us—you can verify us.

## 💡 Calculation Methodology (Auditable)

We don't hide our math. We use realistic, conservative numbers to build trust:

- **Real Efficiency**: 80% derating (accounts for weather/shade/inverter loss)
- **Degradation**: 0.5% annual panel output decline
- **Maintenance Buffer**: Optional $150/yr maintenance factor
- **Inverter Replacement**: Factored at Year 12 & 24 (customizable)
- **Inflation**: 4% annual utility rate increase (customizable)
