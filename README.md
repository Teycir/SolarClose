## 💡 What Makes Our Calculator Accurate

We use real-world numbers, not perfect lab conditions:

- **Real Efficiency**: 80% (accounts for weather, shade, and dirt on panels)
- **Panel Aging**: Panels produce slightly less each year (0.5% decline)
- **Maintenance**: $150/year for cleaning and upkeep
- **Inverter Replacement**: Budgeted at year 13
- **Tax Credits**: 30% federal credit included (adjustable)
- **Rising Electric Rates**: 4% annual increase (adjustable)
- **State Rebates**: Add any local incentives

This gives your customers honest, realistic expectations they can trust.
